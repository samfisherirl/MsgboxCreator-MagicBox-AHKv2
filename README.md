MsgboxCreator.ahk for v2

from Boiler https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=60507:

"This is a v2 version of the MsgBox creator used in SciTE4AutoHotkey and first posted by Thalon here https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/10623-messagebox-creator/ "

"I always found it useful, so I wanted a version for v2. It of course is modified to output v2 code, and it has a couple extra v2-specific options. This version was made for use with any editor since it just copies the code to the clipboard, although it can be modified to be more integrated into specific editors."
